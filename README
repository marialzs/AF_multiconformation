This folder includes all the information needed to reproduce the eperiments in the paper

There are 6 folders with data:
1) af_msas: msas we used to generate the ensembles
2) bound_pdbs: text files for each protein system with all PDBs in the set that had a ligand bound at the site of interest
3) ftmove_results: csv and .pse files with hot-spot clusters and their scores for each binding site found in PDB ensembles of each system
4) clustered_ftmove_results: csv and .pse files with hot-spot clusters and their scores for each binding site found in clustered AF results of each system
5) global_rmsds: .txt files with global RMSD results of AF ensembles aligned to a referenece pdb for each system, default AF data has no 'shallow' in the name
6) plddts: .txt files with pLDDT  results of AF ensembles for each system, default AF data has no 'shallow' in the name


And 3 folders with scripts:
1) clustering: scripts to cluster AF structures
               - run rmsd_matrix.py to get the pairwise rmsd matrix
               - run cluster_by_rmsd.py to cluster the structures; USAGE: python cluster_by_rmsd.py -f rmsd_matrix.txt -r radius -t reps 

2) fpocket_scripts: scripts for pocket volume calculation with Fpocket
               - you need a reference pdb structure, reference ligand (which binds at the pocket of interest) and a directory with structures
               - USAGE: bash pocket_vol_pipeline.sh ref_pdb ref_lig struct_dir

3) rmsd_scripts: scripts to calculate local RMSDs
               - there are two loop* and two chain* scripts
               - loop* scripts calculate a loop RMSD
               - chain* scripts calculate side chain RMSD
               - two of the scripts have *pdbs at the end, meaning those were used for local RMSD calculation for structures from PDB. The other two were used for AF structures
               - PDB USAGE: python loop_rmsd.py dir_w_pdbs/ start_res stop_res closed_ref open_ref ftmove_scores_path site_number bound_info_txt
                            python chain_rmsd.py dir_w_pdbs/ resnum,resnum,resnum  closed_ref open_ref ftmove_scores_path site_number bound_info_txt
               - AF USAGE: python loop_rmsd.py dir_w_pdbs/ start_res stop_res closed_ref open_ref ftmove_scores_path site_number 
       	       	       	   python chain_rmsd.py dir_w_pdbs/ resnum,resnum,resnum  closed_ref open_ref ftmove_scores_path site_number 


There is one .txt file called clusterinfo.txt, it contains radii used for clustering for each system
